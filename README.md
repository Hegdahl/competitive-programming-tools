# Competitive Programming Tools
My tools for programming competitions.

My data structures and algorithms have a new home:
https://github.com/Hegdahl/competitive-programming-lib

```bash
> cpt --help
```
```
Usage: cpt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Entry point for all cpt commands.

  Run `cpt COMMAND --help` for more info about the command.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  expand  Replace cpt includes with source code (for submission to online...
  flush   Clears temporary data stored by competitive programming tools.
  listen  Listen for information about problems from the "Competitive...
  run     Executes a program from source.
  stress  Run `source` repeatedly with input from generated by the...
  submit  Figure out where to submit a `source`, then submit it and show...
```

## Example usage

## Platform support
No.

I only tested this on my own computer running linux.

## Installation

- Install python3, pip, and g++.
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into it

- run this (maybe `pip3` instead of `pip` depending on platform)
```bash
> pip install -e .
```
- Figure out where pip put the scripts and add that folder to $PATH.
In my case that would be adding this to my `.bashrc`:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
```

Then there are some environment variables
competitive-programming-tools expects you to set:
```
TEMP:            temporary directory, typically /tmp
CPT_EXPAND_PATH: directories for which to expand includes,
                 separated by ':'
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Expanding local includes

The command
```bash
cpt expand file.cpp
```
prints the content of `file.cpp` with local includes
(from the directory `include` in competitive programming tools)
replaced with their contents recursively.
This allows you to put data structures and algorithms in their
own files and include instead of copy pasting.

Here is how i use it:
```vim
nnoremap <F9> :w<enter>:!echo %:p \| cpt expand - --tmp-file \| wl-copy<enter><enter>
nnoremap <F10> :w<enter>:!echo %:p \| cpt expand - \| wl-copy<enter><enter>
```
Putting these lines in the vim configuration lets you
hit F9 to put the expanded source code in a temporary file,
and copies the path of the temporary file to the clipboard.
Hitting F10 puts the expanded source code directly in the clipboard.
I use both because it differs between online judges wether
submitting by pasting or by uploading a file is easier.
